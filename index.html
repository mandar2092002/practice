            -->The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck argues that individuals should seek to<br>
            find meaning through what they find to be important and only engage in values<br>
            that they can control. Values (such as popularity) that are not under a <br>
            person's control, are, according to the book, 'bad values'.
